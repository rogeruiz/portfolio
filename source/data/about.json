    "I was a prepress manager for years. I prepared jobs for an HP Indigo 5000 which could do some serious printing. I no longer do anything in the printing world, but it still fascinates me.",
    "I'm currently a software engineer at Cond√© Nast. I build websites. I build interfaces. I build products. From concept to execution, I'm interested in all aspects of user experience, interface design, and code optimizations. I've worked with clients such as JetBlue, Caesars Casinos, WellPoint, Chipotle, Ford, and others.",
